      "text": "The 2025 India–Pakistan conflict was a brief armed conflict between India and Pakistan that began on 7 May 2025, after India launched missile strikes on Pakistan, in a military campaign codenamed Operation Sindoor . [ a ] India said that the operation was in response to the Pahalgam terrorist attack in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir on 22 April 2025 in which 26 civilians were killed. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] India accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism , which Pakistan denied.\n\nOn 7 May, India launched Operation Sindoor with missile strikes on terrorism-related infrastructure facilities of Pakistan-based militant groups Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir , and said that no Pakistani military or civilian facilities were targeted. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] According to Pakistan, the Indian strikes hit civilian areas, including mosques, and resulted in civilian casualties. Following these strikes, there were border skirmishes and drone strikes between the two countries. Pakistan's army retaliated on 7 May, by launching a blitz of mortar shells on Jammu , particularly Poonch , killing civilians, [ 11 ] and damaging homes and religious sites. [ 12 ] This conflict marked the first drone battle between the two nuclear-armed nations. [ 13 ]\n\nIn the early hours of 10 May, India accused Pakistan of launching missile attacks on Indian air bases [ 14 ] including the Sirsa air base [ 15 ] while Pakistan accused India of launching attacks on several Pakistan air bases, [ 14 ] [ 16 ] including Nur Khan air base , Rafiqi air base , and Murid air base . [ 14 ] [ 17 ] As conflict escalated on 10 May, Pakistan launched its Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos , [ b ] in which it said it had targeted several Indian military bases, including Udhampur air base , Pathankot air base and Adampur air base . [ 21 ]\n\nAfter the four-day military conflict, both India and Pakistan announced that a ceasefire had been agreed after a hotline communication between their DGMOs (Directors General of Military Operations) on 10 May 2025. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held extensive correspondence with both Indian and Pakistani officials during the negotiations. The ceasefire has been holding, with resumed commercial flights and normalcy reported from both countries. [ 24 ] [ 25 ]\n\n"
